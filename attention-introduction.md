* Cannot use proximity to understand/gain info from the sentence
* We may think Roopali is a person, but if we read entire sentence then she is a cow
* We can think annoying is related to roopali, can, be , but, she, is
* Our focus is needs to be in roopali, she, cow, annoying
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**If we pass this to normal RNN, then it will be difficult to understand where to focus more**</mark>
* We convert text into tokens, t1 t2â€¦..
* Then we convert them into vectors
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**If we want to give importance we can come up with some mechanism of weight w1, w2â€¦..**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**This will result into new vector y1, y2â€¦.**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**This will be trainable weights**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**This y1, y2.. will be able to give more contextual information**</mark>
* We need to train in such a way that w1, w4, w6 and w10 should be more

* In both the sentences, both the bank are having different meaning, which we get after reading the entire sentence
* If sentence has bank and river then it means we are talking about a water body
* If sentence has state, bank, india then it means we are talking about a financial institution
* Since both the banks have different meaning, so it should be encoded differently
* Also attention should be given differently
* So we multiply it with attention weights â€“ W1, W2â€¦.
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**This weights are trainable**</mark>

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**We first encode the sentence â€“ V1**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Then apply re-weigh mechanism**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**V1.V1 = W11**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**V1.V2 = W12....**</mark>
* This will contain better context information
* We do dot product
*

* When we do dot product of 2 vectors, we get scalar â€“ W11, W12â€¦.
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**After that we normalize them such that W11 +  W12 + W13 + W14 = 1**</mark>
* Similarly we do for V2.V1 alsoâ€¦.
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**In Re-weighing, we multiply this weights with V1, V2.... so as to get Y1, Y2....**</mark>
