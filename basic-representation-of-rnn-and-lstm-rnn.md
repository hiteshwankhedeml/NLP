* RNN has short term memory
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**In LSTM we are also adding a long term memory along with the short term memory**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Responsibility of long term memory is to add what context is required and remove context which is not required**</mark>
