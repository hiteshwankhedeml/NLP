* BM25 is a <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**ranking function**</mark> that improves on TF-IDF.
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**We have a query, and we want to find the best document which matches the query**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Does not take context or semantics into account**</mark><mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">.</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Term frequency saturation**</mark><mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">: increases score when a term occurs more, but limits the effect of very high frequencies â†’ avoids over-weighting and keyword stuffing.</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Document length normalization**</mark><mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">: penalizes long documents by comparing their length to the average document length â†’ required because in TF-IDF, longer documents naturally get higher scores due to more term occurrences, leading to unfair advantage.</mark>
* **Tunable parameters**:
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**k1â†’ controls how quickly term frequency saturates.**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**b â†’ controls strength of length normalization.**</mark>
* Overall advantage: BM25 balances relevance by considering both diminishing returns of term frequency and fair treatment of document length, giving more accurate results than TF-IDF.
