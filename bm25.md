# ðŸŸ¢ BM25

* BM25 is a ranking function that improves on TF-IDF.
* We have a query, and we want to find the best document which matches the query
* BM25 **does not take context or semantics into account**.
* **Term frequency saturation**: increases score when a term occurs more, but limits the effect of very high frequencies â†’ avoids over-weighting and keyword stuffing.
* **Document length normalization**: penalizes long documents by comparing their length to the average document length â†’ required because in TF-IDF, longer documents naturally get higher scores due to more term occurrences, leading to unfair advantage.
* **Tunable parameters**:
  * k1k\_1 â†’ controls how quickly term frequency saturates.
  * bb â†’ controls strength of length normalization.
* Overall advantage: BM25 balances relevance by considering both diminishing returns of term frequency and fair treatment of document length, giving more accurate results than TF-IDF.
