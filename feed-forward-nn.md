* To solve non linearity (By using activation function)
* Processing each position independently
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Self attention captures relationship between tokens**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Processes each token representation independently**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**This helps in transforming these representation further and allows the model to learn richer representation**</mark>
* Adds depth to the model
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**More the depth, more learning will be there**</mark>
