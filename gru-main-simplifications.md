# GRU Main Simplifications

1. Both states vectors merged into a single vector
2. <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Single gate controller z(t) controls – input gate and forget gate**</mark>

* If z(t) -> 1            forget gate = 1 ⇒ Input gate = 1 – 1 = 0      Closed
* If z(t) -> 0            forget gate = 0 ⇒ Input gate = 1 – 0 = 1      Open
* Whenever a new information is written in memory, erase that location or erase previous memory

3. Full state vector h(t) is the output at every time stamp
4. <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Reset gate R(t) controls which part of the previous state will be shown to g(t) main layer**</mark>

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**If r(t) = 0, we don’t want to pass any previous information, we want to pass only fresh information**</mark>
* If r(t) = 1, we pass previous + fresh  &#x20;
