* Sentences can be of different lengths
* Today we going to learn NMT - 1st sentence
* After this we will be learning attention mechanism tomorrow - 2nd sentence
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**While feeding to RNN, we need to specify sequence length**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**For shorter sentence we can add padding**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**For longer sentence we can split into 2**</mark>
